Python Function----
_____________

=>A function can be defined as the organized block of reusable code, which can be called whenever required.
=>Python allows us to divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as a function.
=>A function can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the Python program.

There are mainly two types of functions.

	1)User-define functions ---
		>The user-defined functions are those define by the user to perform the specific task.
	2)Built-in functions --
		>The built-in functions are those functions that are pre-defined in Python.
		>Python provide us various inbuilt functions like range() or print()

Advantage of Functions in Python----

=>Using functions, we can avoid rewriting the same logic/code again and again in a program.
=>We can call Python functions multiple times in a program and anywhere in a program.
=>We can track a large Python program easily when it is divided into multiple functions.
=>Reusability is the main achievement of Python functions.

Creating a Function-----
______________

Syntax:

Function Defination---

	def my_function(parameters):  
	    function_block  
	return expression  

Function calling---
	
	my_function(arguments)


=>A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
=>An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.
