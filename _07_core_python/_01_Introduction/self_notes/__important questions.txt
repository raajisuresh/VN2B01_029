How interpreter works in python ?
--Instead of translating source code to machine code like C++, Python code it translated to bytecode.
ex--PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.



What is compiler ?
--A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that a computer's processor uses.



Python features...
--Python is a dynamic, high level, free open source and interpreted programming  language. 
--Easy to code
--Free and Open Source
--Object-Oriented Language
--GUI Programming Support
--High-Level Language
--Extensible feature
--Python is Portable language


What is dynamically typed programming language ?
--Dynamically-typed languages are those where the interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time.


Procedure Oriented vs Object oriented programming languages--
	
Procedural Oriented Programming--
	Procedural Oriented Programming is a programming language that follows a step-by-step approach to break down a task into a collection of variables and routines (or subroutines) through a sequence of instructions.
--In procedural programming, program is divided into small parts called functions.
--Procedural programming follows top down approach.
--There is no access specifier in procedural programming.
--Procedural programming does not have any proper way for hiding data so it is less secure.
--In procedural programming, function is more important than data.

Object Oriented Programming--
	Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
--In object oriented programming, program is divided into small parts called objects.
--Object oriented programming follows bottom up approach.
--Object oriented programming have access specifiers like private, public, protected etc
--Object oriented programming provides data hiding so it is more secure.
--In object oriented programming, data is more important than function.



Different ways to run python program--
--Interactive Mode.
--Command Line.
--Text Editor (VS Code)
--IDE (PyCharm)


What is source file ?
--Source files contain the data that is being extracted from the source system before it's being transformed to the Common Data Format.


cpython vs ironpyhon vs jython---
cpython--
It is the original Python implementation, CPython has the highest compatibility with a variety of Python packages and modules and is the best choice if users need to write code that completely matches the Python standards.

Ironpython--
IronPython is the popular Python implementation that has been written in C-Sharp (C#) and has been designed to run on the .NET platform.

jpython--
Jython is another Python implementation that has been written in the Java language whose implementation can run in Java platforms. 



What is interactive progragramming ?
--Interactive programming, also known as live coding, refers to any computer programming language that allows the creator to make changes to the program while it is running.



What is high-level programming language ?
--A high-level language is one that is user-oriented in that it has been designed to make it straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code.
