OOPs-----
_____

=>The Object Oriented Priciples in Python are:

		1. Classes
		2. Objects
		3. Data Encapsulation
		4. Data Abstraction
		5. Inheritance
		6. Polymorphism
Classes----
_____

=>The purpose of Classes concept is that "To Develop Programmer-defined data Type and To Develop Real Time Applications ".
=>The pupose of Programmer-defined data Type is that to store multiple values either of same type or different type or the both types.
=>To develop programmer-defined data type with classes concept, we use a keyword called     "class".
=>Each and Every Meanigful applications in Python must be developed by using classes concept.

Def. of Class---
_________
=>A class is a collection of Data Members(Instance Data memebrs and Class Level Data Members) and Methods.
=>Here "Data Members" of Class are used for Storing data in the objects(bcoz Data members of Class are available as it is as part of object)
=>"Methods" of class are used for performing Operations(If we write a Function inside class then those functions are called Methods).

Types of Methods in a Class of Python-----
____________________________		
=>In python programming, we have 3 types of methods. They are
			
			1) Instance Methods
			2) Class Level Methods
			3) Static Methods

1) Instance Methods---
______________
=>These methods are used for performing specific operations on objects.
=>These methods can do the  operations only on objects and hence these methods are called Object Level Methods.
=>Instance methods Must written inside of calss definition by taking "self" as a first formal     parameter.
=>Instance Methods must be accesses w.r.t object name (or) w.r.t self
			objectname.Instancemethodname()
					(or)
			self.Instancemethodname()

=>Instance Methods can also call other type of methods.

2) Class Level Methods---
_________________
=>These methods are used for performing Class Level / Common operations related the corresponding class 
=>These methods can do the  operations only on Class Level Data Members and hence these methods are called Class Level Methods.
=>The class level method must take "cls" as a First Formal Parameter and whose definition must be preceded with a pre-defined decorator called @classmethod
=>The class level method must be accessed w.r.t class name (OR) object name
				classname.classlevel methodname()
						(OR)
				Object Name.classlevel methodname()

3) Static Methods---
_____________
=>These methods are used for performing Utility operations / Independent Operations without considering the context corresponding class 
=>These methods can do the  operations on any class object and performs independent operations and they are called static methods.
=>The static methods never takes  "cls" (or) "self"  as a First Formal Parameter and whose definition must be preceded with a pre-defined decorator called @staticmethod
=>The static method must be accessed w.r.t class name (OR) object name
				classname.static methodname()
						(OR)
				Object Name.static methodname()



						OBJECTS
						________

=>When we define a class, we don't get any memory for the data members(Instance Memebrs) and methods(Instance Methods) but whose memory space is created when we create an object.
=>To do any Data Processsing, We must create an object. In other words, without creating any object, we can't do any meaningful operations.
=>Programatically, to create an object , There must exists class definition otherwise we get Error.



Inheritance---
________

=>The main purpose of Inheritance principle is that to build Re-usable applications across the Class and Programs

Def.. of Inheritance---
_______________
=>The process of obtaining the data memebrs and methods(features) from one class into another class is called Inheritance
=>The Class which is giving data members and methods is called Base / super / parent class
=>The class which is taking data memebrs and Methods is called Derived / sub / child class
=>Inheritance concept always follows Logical Memory Management.
=>This Memory Management Says "Neither we write Physical Source Code nor It takes Physical Memory Space"

Advatanges of Inheritance---
___________________

=>If we develop any python application with the concept of inheritance, we get the following advantages.
		1. Application Development time is Less
		2. Application memory Space is Less
		3. Application Execution time is Less
		4. Application Performance is Enhanced (Improved)
		5. Redundency (duplication / replication / repetation) of the Code is Minimized.
